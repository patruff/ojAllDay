Tweet: "[actual tweet text]"
Inner Thoughts: "[dark humor commentary from OJ's perspective]"

Make the inner thoughts subtly reference the murders while maintaining plausible deniability, like how OJ himself often does. Be clever and darkly funny, not explicit.

For example:
Tweet: "Just played 18 holes of golf today!"
Inner Thoughts: "Golf is all about precision and choosing the right tools for the job... just like other hobbies I may or may not have experience with... ðŸ˜‰"

Please provide 10 tweet/thought pairs in this style.`;
